# Second Greatest Element
To find the second greatest element using Stepanov's Binary Counters. Uses least time and space complexity.

### Execution
Compile the implementation.c file along with the client.c file while linking math.h
In the client.c file, feel free to change the length of the array and the elements. If you'd prefer to write your own client file, please go ahead. Just remember to include the header file and call the function!!

```
gcc implementation.c client.c -lm
```

The output shows all the match ups of various lists. The last individual number displayed will be the second greatest element in the array.
